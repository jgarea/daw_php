## jaxon-examples

Sample codes demonstrating the Jaxon library usage.

#### The examples

All examples are based on the helloword.php example in the original Xajax repository https://github.com/Xajax/Xajax/blob/master/examples/helloworld.php.

#### Installation

Download the files of this repository to your web server.

Cd to the directory and run the `composer update` command.
This will install the Jaxon packages and their dependencies.

Configure your web server to give access to the `web` subdirectory, and edit the `menu_subdir()` function in the `includes\menu.php` file accordingly.
You will then be able to browse the examples.

That's it.
